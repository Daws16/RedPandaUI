NOTES:
---------

This addon has been developed for aetherflow.
Remember, at the current state, you can't select in game entities with these elements, so don't hide group frame or target frame if you want the old interaction system.
You can change settings in the RedPanda_UI_Options.lua file.
For more information about aetherflow please go to [Aertherflow forums](https://forum.aetherflow.com/).
